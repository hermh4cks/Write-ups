# Lab: Username enumeration via different responses

## Description

 This lab is vulnerable to username enumeration and password brute-force attacks. It has an account with a predictable username and password, which can be found in the following wordlists:
    Candidate [usernames](https://github.com/hermh4cks/Write-ups/blob/main/Portswigger/2.authentication/usernames)
    Candidate [passwords](https://github.com/hermh4cks/Write-ups/blob/main/Portswigger/2.authentication/passwords)
To solve the lab, enumerate a valid username, brute-force this user's password, then access their account page.
