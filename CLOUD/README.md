# Hacking in the Cloud

Here you will find a collection of the many great labs that I have found to practice hacking within cloud environments. Many companies are switching over to hosting more and more resources in the cloud; because of this the cloud has become a huge attack surface for hackers. While the cloud providers themselves often have extensive security, it falls on the company using the service to secure their resources inside the cloud. Due to this, misconfigurations, lax permissions, vulnerable serverless functions, and other issues inside the cloud have become critical to the cyber kill chain for nefarious actors and red-teamers alike. For that reason this section is titled hacking in the cloud. I hope you enjoy the write-ups, however following the labs at your own pace will teach you much more than simply reading my methods. Instead use the contained Labs as a guide if you get stuck while trying to solve the labs on your own. As always happy hacking!
