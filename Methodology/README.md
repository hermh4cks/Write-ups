## 4. Service Version Exploits - A service may have a known vulnerabilty

## 5. Pentesting Services - Each service has a unique methodogy when it comes to attack

## 6. Phishing - People make mistakes, learn to exploit them

## 7. Getting a Shell - Found a way to execute code? Turn it into a shell

## 8. Living off the land - Using target's built in functionality to attack it

## 9. Exfiltration - You snuck in, now sneak some data out

## 10. Privilege Escalation - If you not root/Administrator you should find a way to escalate privileges
