# Methodologies
By Herman Detwiler

A large part of this was taken from [Hacktricks](https://book.hacktricks.xyz/welcome/readme), I have combined the information I found the most useful on that site with my own OSCP notes. As well as any notes that I gather from doing CTFs. The intention of posting this up, is that writing it helps me learn, and in the hopes that reading it helps someone else. If it peaks your interest, reading only helps so much. Go out and try these on systems you own or on servers you have permission to.

## Pre-attack

+ ### Defining Scope

+ ### Defining Objective

## 0. Pysical
Hardware and Hacking
	
+ ### Setting up your attack machine

+ ### Setting up a home lab

+ ### Hardware Hacking

## 1. Discovery
Finding Hosts and Assets
	
+ ### [Host Discovery from inside a network](/network/readme.md#network-hacking)

+ ### [Asset Discovery from the internet](/External/readme.md#external-recon)

## 2. Network
Getting a lay of the land

+ ### Pentesting the Network

## 3. Service Discovery
Port scanning specific services


## 4. Service Version Exploits
A service may have a known vulnerabilty

## 5. Pentesting Services
Each service has a unique methodogy when it comes to attack

## 6. Phishing
People make mistakes, learn to exploit them

## 7. Getting a Shell
Found a way to execute code? Turn it into a shell

## 8. Living off the land
Using target's built in functionality to attack it

## 9. Exfiltration
You snuck in, now sneak some data out

## 10. Privilege Escalation
If you not root/Administrator you should find a way to escalate privileges

## 11. POST
Loot all the data you can with root access, and find a way to persist within the system

## 12.Pivoting
Now that you pwned this system, can you use it to get to another target?
