# RA from TryHackMe

You have gained access to the internal network of WindCorp, the multibillion dollar company, running an extensive social media campaign claiming to be unhackable (ha! so much for that claim!).

Next step would be to take their crown jewels and get full access to their internal network. You have spotted a new windows machine that may lead you to your end goal. Can you conquer this end boss and own their internal network?

Happy Hacking!
