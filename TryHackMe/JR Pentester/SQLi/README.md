# SQLi tryhackme's JR pentester path

## 1) Brief

*SQL (Structured Query Language) Injection, mostly referred to as SQLi, is an attack on a web application database server that causes malicious queries to be executed. When a web application communicates with a database using input from a user that hasn't been properly validated, there runs the putential of an attacker being able to steal delete or alter private and suctomer data and also attack the web applications authentication methods to private or customer areas. This is why as well as SQLi being one of the oldest web application vulnerabilities, it also can be the most damaging.*

*In this room, you will learn what databases are, what SQL is with some basic SQL commands, how to detect SQL vulnerabilities, how to exploit SQLi vulnerabilities and as a developer how you can protect yourself against SQL injection.*

## 2) What is a Detabase?

*If you're not used to working with databases or exploiting them, there's probably some new terminology to get used to, so let's start with some basics on how databases are structured and how they work.*

*A database is a way of electronically storing collections of data in an organised manner. A database is controlled by a DBMS wich is an acronym for Database Management System*

**What are tables?**

A table is made up of columns and rows, a useful way to imagine a table is like a grid with the columns going across the top from left to right containing the name of the cell and the rows going from top to bottom with each one having the actual data.

**TABLE 1's Columns**
| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
| - | - | - |

**TABLE 1's Rows**

| Column 1 |
| - |
| row 1 | 
| row 2 |
| row 3 |


Columns:

Each column, better referred to as a field has a unique name per table. When creating a column, you also set the type of data it will contain, common ones being integer (numbers), strings (standard text) or dates. Some databases can contain much more complex data, such as geospatial, which contains location information. Setting the data type also ensures that incorrect information isn't stored, such as the string "hello world" being stored in a column meant for dates. If this happens, the database server will usually produce an error message. A column containing an integer can also have an auto-increment feature enabled; this gives each row of data a unique number that grows (increments) with each subsequent row, doing so creates what is called a key field, a key field has to be unique for every row of data which can be used to find that exact row in SQL queries.

**Rows:**

Rows or records are what contains the individual lines of data. When you add data to the table, a new row/record is created, and when you delete data, a row/record is removed. 

**Relational Vs Non-Relational Databases:**

A relational database, stores information in tables and often the tables have shared information between them, they use columns to specify and define the data being stored and rows to actually store the data. The tables will often contain a column that has a unique ID (primary key) which will then be used in other tables to reference it and cause a relationship between the tables, hence the name relational database.


Non-relational databases sometimes called NoSQL on the other hand is any sort of database that doesn't use tables, columns and rows to store the data, a specific database layout doesn't need to be constructed so each row of data can contain different information which can give more flexibility over a relational database.  Some popular databases of this type are MongoDB, Cassandra and ElasticSearch.


Now you've learnt what a database is, let's learn how we can actually talk to it using SQL.

## 3) What is SQL



SQL (Structured Query Language) is a feature-rich language used for querying databases, these SQL queries are better referred to as statements.


The simplest of the commands which we'll cover in this task is used to retrieve (select), update, insert and delete data. Although somewhat similar, some databases servers have their own syntax and slight changes to how things work. All of these examples are based on a MySQL database. After learning the lessons, you'll easily be able to search for alternative syntax online for the different servers. It's worth noting that SQL syntax is not case sensitive.

### Select

`select * from users;` will select all data from the users table

| id | username | password |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | jon | pass123 |
| 2 | admin | p4ssword |
| 3 | martin | secret123 |

`select username, password from users;` will return just the username and password columns

| username | password |
| - | - |
| jon | pass123 |
| admin | p4ssword |
| martin | secret123 |


`select * from users Limit 1;` will return just the first row

| id | username | password |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | jon | pass123 |

`select * from users where username='admin';` only rows where username is admin

| id | username | password |
| - | - | - |
| 2 | admin | p4ssword |

`select * from users where username!= 'admin';` only rows where username is not admin

| id | username | password |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | jon | pass123 |
| 3 | martin | secret123 |

`select * from users wjere username='admin' or username='jon'` 

| id | username | password |
| - | - | - |
| 1 | jon | pass123 |
| 2 | admin | p4ssword |

`select * from users where username='admin' and password='p4ssword';`

| id | username | password |
| - | - | - |
| 2 | admin | p4ssword |


Using the like clause allows you to specify data that isn't an exact match but instead either starts, contains or ends with certain characters by choosing where to place the wildcard character represented by a percentage sign %.


`select * from users where username like 'a%';` letters beginning with a

`select * from users where username like '%n';` letters ending in n

`select * from users where username like '%mi%';` letters mi contained within


### Union
